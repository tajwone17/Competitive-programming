# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains initial implementations of solutions to various competitive programming problems from popular platforms like CodeForces, AtCoder, CodeChef, HackerRank, and LeetCode. These implementations are designed to help with problem-solving practice and learning efficient algorithms.

## Folder Structure
- **CodeForce**: Contains solutions for problems from the CodeForces platform.
- **AtCoder**: Includes solutions for problems from the AtCoder platform.
- **Code Chef**: Solutions to CodeChef problems are organized here.
- **HackerRank**: Solutions to HackerRank challenges are available in this folder.
- **Leetcode**: This section features solutions to problems from LeetCode.
- **Onsite NEUB**: Onsite problem solutions for NEUB (North East University Bangladesh) competitions.

## Notable Files

- **Template.cpp**: A template file for starting competitive programming problems.
- **README.md**: Documentation and overview of the repository.


## How to Use
1. Navigate to the relevant folder for the problem platform (e.g., `CodeForce` or `Leetcode`).
2. Explore and study the problem solutions provided.
3. Modify or improve solutions as needed for practice.

## Disclaimer
These implementations are initial solutions and may require further optimization. Ensure you fully understand the problem constraints before directly using the code.

Happy Coding!
